Belgium stands as a key contributor within the global remittance landscape, showcasing remarkable growth in remittance outflows over the last two decades. This is supplemented by Belgium's varied demographic profile, where migrants alongside second-generation migrants, account for more than a third of the Belgium’s population in 2022. Remittances serve as an essential lifeline, providing crucial financial support to family members of migrants in the remittance recipient countries. Given Belgium's considerable remittance outflows and its substantial migrant population, understanding the dynamics of remittance flows becomes necessary. 

This study systematically analyzes Belgium's remittance landscape, utilizing data from diverse sources to explore trends and drivers, employing an two-step GMM with instrumental variables (IV) approach. The research focused on estimating bilateral remittance outflows to 102 corridors and assessing the impact of various determinants

The market analysis part of the [O-REMIT project](https://belgium.iom.int/o-remit), implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on behalf of the Belgian Directorate-General for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid, offers a comprehensive exploration of remittance transaction costs from Belgium to various international corridors. The market analysis, encompassed data collection from August to November 2023, and yielded critical insights into the dynamics of transaction costs in the realm of international money transfers from Belgium, a field where data is considerably lacking. 

This report highlights the pressing need for more detailed data on the transaction costs associated with remittances from Belgium. During the development of the report, it was notable the significant data gap on transaction costs of remittances in Belgium, highlighting the critical role of having higher availability of transaction cost data. Although the data provides a snapshot limited to the specific period of data collection, it crucially points to Belgium's challenges in meeting the SDG 10.c. This goal strives to reduce transaction costs below 3% and to eliminate corridors with costs above 5% by 2030.

The Manual on Child-Specific Data Capacity Strengthening on Children on the Move is the result of a highly collaborative and multi-step effort that involved multiple members of the cross-sectoral International Data Alliance for Children on the Move (IDAC). It was conceptualized and developed by IDAC’s Working Group 1, which is led by the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) and focuses on national data capacity-strengthening to ensure that migrant and displaced children are counted and seen in policy and programme design. 

The manual aims to help countries and their national statistical systems to improve the collection, analysis, sharing and use of data on children on the move. It provides analytical guidance to national statistical authorities and relevant actors on how to acquire or enhance the appropriate capacity to collect data on migrant and displaced children, in compliance with the United Nations’ Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. It also shares several country experiences regarding migration data flows and official statistics.

### **Las Características y el Desarrollo de la Economía Popular Un Modelo Formal con Evidencia Etnográfica**

This paper explores the reasons underlying the economic prosperity of certain popular merchants in Bolivia. Even if economics often associates popular merchants with poor economic performance and low productivity, anthropological evidence shows the existence of large fortunes in the Bolivian popular economy (Tassi et al., 2013). The paper develops a formal model which traces back the origin of this prosperity in the coopetitive capacity (competitive plus cooperative) of popular merchants built upon the sharing of input costs. The paper argues that the coopetitive capacity of these actors is based on social networks of godfatherhood weaved at popular celebrations, which is documented with ethnographic evidence.
