        My name is Nicol√°s M√°rquez, a data enthusiast with a passion for turning numbers into narratives that drive decision-making and spark meaningful change. My journey began in the world of economics, where I developed a solid foundation in mathematics, statistics and econometrics‚Äîtools that have become the backbone of my work today. Over the years, I‚Äôve expanded my expertise to include data visualization, advanced analytics and machine learning, enabling me to transform raw data into clear, actionable insights.

        Throughout my career, I‚Äôve worked on projects that harness the power of data, supporting everything from everyday business decisions to driving global change. Whether it‚Äôs optimizing business processes, understanding complex trends, or communicating findings to diverse audiences, I bring a comprehensive approach to every project I undertake‚Äîfrom the initial concept of what to measure, through careful data preparation and analysis, to the impactful presentation of data insights.

        Beyond my professional endeavors, I‚Äôm a tech geek at heart. My love for computers goes beyond coding, which is why my next personal project is to build my own custom PC. I bring the same curiosity and hands-on approach to my work, whether it's staying updated with the latest in data analytics or experimenting with developments in other fields.       </p>
