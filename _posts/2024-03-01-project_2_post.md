Developed an application to automate business processes, perform exploratory data analysis, and create a sales dashboard with forecasting capabilities.

    In the fast-paced world of retail, where every decision has a direct impact on sales and customer satisfaction, businesses need reliable tools to make data-driven decisions swiftly. This necessity led to the creation of a custom sales dashboard that does more than just visualize data. This application, powered by a combination of **Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, BeautifulSoup, Scipy, Requests, and Plotly,** and other libraries has advanced how Yachaywasi Bookstores operates, providing both real-time analytics and advanced forecasting, this combined with other advancements has made the bookstore the largest bookstore chain in Bolivia.

    One of the standout features of the application is its flexibility. It allows users to simulate various forecasting scenarios, empowering management to predict sales under different conditions. This capability is paired with a web scraping tool powered by BeautifulSoup and Requests, enabling the system to pull relevant data from external sources for comparison and further analysis. The result is a comprehensive solution that not only processes internal data but also contextualizes it with external market trends.

    The project came to life following a review of internal workflows, which revealed inefficiencies in how data was updated and reported. These inefficiencies made decision-making slow, especially in critical moments such as inventory management or planning marketing campaigns. By addressing these pain points, the dashboard eliminated bottlenecks, and the result has been a smoother, more efficient reporting mechanism. **This transformation has reduced the firm’s reporting cycle from sometimes days to minutes.** The application extracts the data from the bookstore’s Management Information System (MIS), allowing for daily updates of sales data. Once extracted, the data undergoes a cleaning and transformation process. This flow ensures that the dashboard always displays accurate and up-to-date sales figures, ready for visualization through interactive charts and tables.

    The evolution of the application has been iterative, with user feedback guiding its development. After its initial release in February 2023, a major update followed in March 2024, adding even more advanced features based on evolving business needs. As the dashboard continues to evolve, it represents not just a tool for data analysis but a critical component of the bookstore’s operational efficiency.
