Developed an interactive report to draw insights from various datasets and previous reports of remittances in Belgium, designed to be embedded and displayed on a website.

  <p>
    Several factors contribute to the growth of remittance flows in Belgium, with a significant influence being the rising migrant population residing in Belgium. Indeed, Belgiumâ€™s remittance landscape is characterized by its demographic composition; according to the Belgian Statistical Office (STATBEL) the number of migrants residing in Belgium was approximately 2.1 million as of 2022. When including second-generation migrants, this figure rises to almost 4 million, accounting for 34.5% of Belgium's total population in 2022. Over the last twenty years, the number of first and second-generation migrants has seen a steady increase, impacting substantially the volume of remittances sent from Belgium. Findings from a previous O-REMIT report, which focused on identifying trends and drivers of remittances in Belgium, indicate that a 1% increase in the migrant population is associated with a 1.024% increase in remittances sent from Belgium, highlighting the impact of migration trends on remittance volumes.

    Belgium's increasing migrant population is marked by significant diversity with varying growth rates among different countries. This is highlighted in the animation below, which illustrates the evolution of the top 20 migrant populations in Belgium over the years according to data from STATBEL. The animation illustrates how some migrant populations residing in Belgium have experienced more rapid growth, contributing to the rich diversity of Belgium's demographic changes. The term "migrant population" in these statistics specifically refers to Belgian residents who were born in a different country, excluding second or third-generation migrants.
